h1. FTANG!

Ftang! is a music player that runs in your web browser.

My fork runs on redis for music collection indexing and session persistence.
As well, websockets are in the works for multi-user playlist sessions.

h2. Requirements
  * gems: rack, sinatra, thin, pow, haml, json, redis, bundler
  * modern web browser (tested against recent firefox, chrome, and safari builds)
  * enough storage space to host your music collection

h2. Installation

<pre>
  <code>
    git clone git://github.com/gzuki/ftang.git && cd ftang
    bundle install
    ./ftang
  </code>
</pre>

h2. Adding your music

By default Ftang! looks for your music at public/music.
  
If you use iTunes then setup is very simple as you can sym-link to your iTunes music directory.
  
To sym-link your iTunes directory on OS X, execute the following commands from inside the ftang folder:
<pre>
  <code>
    ln -s ~/Music/iTunes\ Music/ music
  </code>
</pre>

h2. To do
 * HTML5 storage for playlist
 * multi-user playlist sessions
 * interface enhancements (drag and drop)
 * shuffle playlist
